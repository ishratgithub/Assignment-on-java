## Why Java is highly used?
Java is widely used by developers due to its ease of programming and execution. It allows for the creation of applications that can run on a single device or be distributed across multiple devices within a network. The fact that Java code can be written once and run anywhere at any time is another significant factor contributing to its popularity.

     Find out who achieved the 2nd highest score. (without sorting, use linear searching algorithm)
2. Sort the above scores from according to the order of highest CGPA (don’t use Arrays.sort() method, do it programmatically)
3. Take a CGPA as user input. Now from the given array find if your input CGPA is present using binary search algorithm
4. Generate random 10 integer numbers in an array and print out all the numbers from the array and also print the max and min number from the array.
